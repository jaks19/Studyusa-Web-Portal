git add -u to add all changes and deletes (not new untracked files)
git add -p (need to say yes or no to changes)

git push origin goes to github repo


COMMITTING:
- I can commit a bunch of times (c0,c1,c2,...)without pushing then either push at the end to push the latest commit (cn)
- OR I can push any ci:
    Command 'git log' (to see all commits, even those pushed already, you can push an old commit 2 months ago as well!)
    you get a bunch of commits and ids and identify the needed commit
    Command git push <remote name> <commit hash>:<remote branch name>
    E.g. git push origin f61b48cb8b1877721e2596a6aa65648a68bb605e:master
    E.g. our remote name is origin and the commit hash is 84ef6d98058249fe052f1faf88af7cd0effa2321 and branch name is master
    Note how you can also push to any branch!

BRANCHING:
- If a new feature needs to be developped on a new branch it means you create a separate branch from origin, not the master branch
- On your computer when you are on that branch, you see all commits you made when you were on that branch

- $ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53" (creates the branch AND moves to it)

- Commits get to that branch and the master branch is unaware of those
- You can push to the branch by Command git push <remote name> <remote branch name>

$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

$ git merge iss53
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

$ git branch -d iss53
This deletes the branch once no longer needed
- This allows locally to go back to master branch and merge the local situation of iss53 to master
- Merge conficts occur in your master branch locally if you changed same files in both branches locally
- Use git status to see the conflicts etc and fix
- Once merged, you can now push from master
- Note how a branch is local and you do not push to it

There is a difference between branch and remote. You checkout a branch locally to work on it on a path separate from the master branch
Both the checked out branch and the master branch belong to the same remote (here called origin)
You can create another remote, this just means ANOTHER REPO ENTIRELY
