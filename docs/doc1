There are Users, Submissions, Payments
Basic level views are: Website Home, User Home, Payment Page, File Submission Page

Start Goals:
- Route these primary pages
- Create the views with zero content
- Initialize the dB and define the models (I assume the model will change A LOT).



Middleware definition:
A function defined somewhere else just like a helper fn
But not called somewhere.
Placed as an argument in fn calls e.g.
    app.get(asdfafs, middleware(), function(){
    });
Middleware called before the next function.
Middleware has the word next to go to that next fn called
Can use that to allow program to go to next fn or not depending on conditions

First example, to allow things to occur if logged in. else request to login.
This is the middleware defined somehere as follows:
function isLoggedIn(req, res, next){
    if (req.isAuthenticated()){ // Fn from passport
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect('/login');
}
Will be used in all the routes where we want people logged in to have access
E.g.
app.get('/index/:username', isLoggedIn, function(req, res) {
});



---
In the server code, thanks to passport, we have req.user object giving info about the user logged in
If none logged in, it is undefined
Because we can block routes if no user logged in, we are sure users in those routes are logged in 
So, to render pages, no need to search by id and get user and feed to rendered pages
ANYTIME need user identity: req.user IS YOUR FRIEND

example, when trying to process a request for a user:
if (username != req.user.username){
        req.flash('error', 'You do not have the required permissions to view this page');
        res.redirect('back');
        return;
    }

In all the routes rendering our views, if the page can be seen by a user and by admin for the user, we render 
with the variables: client (the person whose account is being viewed) and viewer (the person viewing the page 
right now, can be an admin or the user who has the account being viewed itself.)
