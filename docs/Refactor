HTML:
- Every element should open its own row and column
- Col-xs makes size apply for sm,md,lg too. Say xs to md good with 12 but too big in lg for instance then specify an xs and a lg
  (Same with offsets)
- For responsiveness, usually if say 2 boxes side by side, in md will be each say 4 col with 1 col space total, in xs you would 
  make each box be say 11px so they go one on top of the other on a cell phone screen
- Use least nestedness i.e. some can be cleverly eliminated after observation
- Only percentages, no pixels
