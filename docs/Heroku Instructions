config vars local are stord in .env

In general, dealing with config vars in heroku CLI: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#production-and-development-modes

Same commands for prod and local but local config vars added to .env while in prod, when added with CLI, config vars will enter a prod .env created by heroku

heroku config -a studyusa gives prod config vars while .env shows local ones

.env should not be git'ed
